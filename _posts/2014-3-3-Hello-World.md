I'm Max. I live in Singapore and I love anything to do with creating things.
- Digital Art - My current interest is with [Adobe Fresco](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-fresco-painting-studio/id1458660369) on iPad
- [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-sg) - I mean, of course Lego!
- Sculpture - Air dry clay, pottery, 3D pens - I love all of them
- Photography - One day I will get my own phone :(
- Stop motion video - This one takes a lot of time!
- Minecraft, Roblox, FNF, Poppy Playtime, Bendy and the Ink Machine ... the list is endless.

This site is new, but I will be adding stuff all the time, so check back regularly!
